# Code of Conduct

Science is hard, and the work of making sure science isn't harder than it needs to be is on all of us. We create our culture, and in the Beckman Research Group, our culture is inclusive.

We value the participation of every member of our community and want to ensure that every contributer has an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, everyone who participates in any Beckman Research Group is expected to show respect and courtesy to other community members at all time.

Dr. Noelle Beckman, as head of the Beckman Research Group, and all group members, are dedicated to a ***harassment-free experience for everyone.*** Discrimination or harassment based on racial or ethnic background, citizenship status, religion (or lack thereof), political affiliation, gender identity/expression, sexual orientation, dis/ability status, age, appearance or body size will not be tolerated. **We do not tolerate harassment by and/or of members of our community in any form**.

We are particularly motivated to support new and/or anxious collaborators, people who are looking to learn and develop their skills, and anyone who has experienced discrimination in the past. 

To make clear what is expected, we ask all members of the community to conform to the following Code of Conduct.

* All communication - online and in person - should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at any time.

* Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other contributers.

* Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.

* Please make an effort to make an inclusive environment for everyone. Give everyone a chance to talk and an opportunity to contribute.

* Watch out for [microaggressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression). Be aware that your actions can be hurtful to others or contribute to a negative environment even if you had no intent of harm. Listen. Offer a genuine apology. Commit to learning and doing better.

Unnaceptable behavior includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of discussions, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

***Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior or discriminatory behavior are expected to comply immediately.***

Members of the community who violate these rules - no matter how much they have contributed to the Beckman Research Group, or how specialised their skill set - will be approached by Noelle Beckman. If inappropriate behaviour persists after a discussion with Noelle, the issue will be escalated according to procedures laid out by the relevant entities at Utah State's [Title IX/Affirmative Action](http://aaeo.usu.edu/)

**To report an issue** please contact [Noelle Beckman](https://github.com/seedscape). All communication will be treated as confidential.

### Flexible working hours

This sentence is stolen from [Bastian Greshake's](https://github.com/gedankenstuecke) email footer and forms the basis of the Beckman Research Group's policy on flexible working:

> While I may be sending this email outside my normal office hours, I have no expectation to receive a reply outside yours.

The hours that members of the group choose to work is up to them. We are each welcome to send work-related emails or pull requests over the weekend or late at night, but no group members are required to reply to them outside of their typical work hours.

Research group members are welcome to work flexibly for any reason. Ideally, all group members will have at least a few hours each week to overlap with Noelle in order to stay in touch on any challenges or successes, but it is the policy of the Whitaker Lab that every member is already self-motivated and doesn't need to work a traditional 9 to 5 day in order to meet their goals.

**If you experience any challenges related to flexible working within the group** please contact [Noelle Beckman](https://github.com/seedscape). All communication will be treated as confidential.
