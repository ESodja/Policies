# General Guidelines
Welcome to the [Beckman Research Group](www.noellebeckman.com)! Research questions in the group are interdisciplinary, drawing on ecology, behavior, and evolution, and involve mathematical, statistical, and empirical approaches. Our aim is to produce actionable science that contributes solutions to socio-environmental problems, disseminate our results to the broader community, and promote a diverse and inclusive community that welcomes and respects diverse backgrounds and perspectives.

This document is a work-in-progress, and I expect it will evolve with the group. Please let Noelle know if you have comments or suggestions.


## Mentoring philosophy  

As a mentor, I offer guidance and support along your graduate career to help you achieve your individual goals. In my research group, I encourage an interdisciplinary approach and provide a stimulating and challenging scientific environment in which members can exchange ideas, pursue independent research, and establish collaborations across disciplines. I adjust my advising style to your level of preparation and independence, and will give advice on both research and career-related issues such as professional development, career options, and work-life balance. To help you build your scientific network, I will connect you with colleagues who might become potential collaborators or mentors that can offer additional perspectives. While I am closely involved in the research of undergraduate and master's students, I expect a high level of independence from doctoral students and postdocs. 

I strive to maintain an open and inclusive environment that promotes collaborative learning and research. I am continually learning and evolving strategies to successfully mentor and foster a diverse community. Each person brings unique experiences, perspectives, and skills to the group, and I hope that we will learn from one another. This diversity will lead to more creative and innovative ideas and solutions. If you have suggestions for promoting diversity and inclusivity, then please let me (Noelle) know how we can remove barriers to ensure everyone has a rewarding, stimulating, and supportive educational experience.

## Group Expectations

* Initially, we will meet one-on-one every week for approximately an hour to discuss goals, directions and progress; the regularity, length, and objective of these meetings will shift as you progress in your career. 

* During your time in the group, we will explore opportunities to expand and strengthen your skillset and advance your short- and long-term goals. Within the first month, you will fill out an Individual Development Form ([graduate students](https://www.unl.edu/gradstudies/current/development/idp), [postdocs](https://postdoc.unl.edu/current/idp_review/)) and meet with Noelle to discuss shared expectations and goals. We will revisit this on a regular basis to ensure you are making progress, and, if necessary, adjust the plan. 

* I trust everyone in the group (including me) to be hardworking, respectful, conscientious, kind, and open to learning. I expect you to manage your own time and projects, but will share time management strategies that I've learned.

* I expect everyone to be active members of the department, start building your scientific network, and have fun! I encourage you to attend the Biology and Ecology Center seminars, sign up to meet with speakers, and participate in social events.

* I expect everyone to [write, write, write](http://www.simonqueenborough.info/assets/pubs/bes-bulletin/2012-BESbulletin-writing.pdf)! We will do this both formally and informally through weekly reflections, blog posts, idea summaries, grant applications, and manuscripts.

* I expect you to get professional and academic advice from me as well as others, because diverse feedback makes for better decisions. You should seriously consider any advice, but ultimately you will make your own informed decision.

* You should take advantage of the training opportunities offered to graduate students by the [Office of Research and Graduate Studies](http://rgs.usu.edu/grts/), [Climate Adaptation Science Program](https://climateadaptation.usu.edu), and the [Ecology Center](http://ecology.usu.edu).

* For more information on institutional policies, read over the graduate student [policies and handbook of the Department of Biology](https://biology.usu.edu/education/graduate-program/prospective_students) and [requirements for the Ecology Center](http://ecology.usu.edu/for_students/index).


## Your first day

* Read the Beckman Research group [code of conduct](https://github.com/SeedscapeEcology/Policies/blob/master/Code_of_Conduct.md). Chat with Noelle if you have any questions about group norms or would like to add or change anything in the code of conduct. 

* Join the Seedscape Ecology [Slack channel](https://seedscapeecology.slack.com) by asking Noelle to send you an invite.

* Set up the weekly reflections by following the guidelines in the [Setting-up-your-weekly-meetings.md]() file. This will include a summary of your Individual Development Plan as well.


## Blog Posts

** Work in progress**

Opportunities to contribute to academic-related writings include:
* the [Seedscape Blog](https://seedscapeblog.wordpress.com/).
* [Verde Elemental](http://verde-elemental.org/) - focused on research in Latin America
* [CoDisperse blog](http://codisperse.weebly.com/blog) - focused on seed dispersal


An additional example from the Whitaker Lab:
1. [Meet 3 people at the Turing Institute](https://github.com/WhitakerLab/Onboarding/blob/master/BLOGGING_EXERCISES/01-MeetThreePeople.md)


## Miscellaneous
Some interesting articles on the importance of [stupidity](http://jcs.biologists.org/content/121/11/1771) and  [failure](http://www.southernfriedscience.com/the-need-to-fail/) in research.
