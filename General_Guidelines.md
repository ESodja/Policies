# General Guidelines
Welcome to the [Beckman Research Group](www.noellebeckman.com)! Research questions in the group are interdisciplinary drawing from ecology, behavior, and evolution and involve mathematical, statistical, and empirical approaches. Our aim is to conduct actionable research that contributes to solutions of socio-environmental problems, disseminate our results to the broader community, and promote a diverse and inclusive community that welcomes and respects diverse backgrounds and perspectives.

This document is a work in progress, and I expect it will evolve with the group. Please let Noelle know if you have comments or suggestions.


## Mentoring philosophy  

As a mentor, I offer guidance and support along your graduate career to help you achieve your individual goals. In my research group, I encourage an interdisciplinary approach within a stimulating and challenging scientific environment in which members can exchange ideas, pursue independent research, and establish interdisciplinary collaborations. I am responsive to differences in levels of preparation and independence and adjust my advising style accordingly. I provide scientific advice on research as well as career-related guidance on issues such as professional development, career options, and work-life balance.  To help you build your scientific network, I will connect you with colleagues who might become potential collaborators or mentors that can offer additional perspectives. While I am closely involved in the research of undergraduate and master's students, I expect a high level of independence from doctoral students and postdocs. 

I strive to maintain an open and inclusive environment in which collaborative learning and research can take place. I am continually learning and evolving strategies to successfully mentor and foster a diverse community. Each person brings to the group unique perspectives, backgrounds, and skills, and I expect that each of us will learn from each other. The integration of these diverse perspectives will lead to more creative and innovative ideas and solutions. If you have suggestions for promoting inclusivity, please let me (Noelle) know how we can remove barriers to ensure everyone has a rewarding, stimulating, and supportive educational experience in which to grow and learn.

## Group Expectations

* As soon as you arrive to the group, we will meet one-on-one once a week for approximately an hour to discuss goals, directions and progress; the regularity, length, and objective of these meetings will shift as you progress in your career. 

* Throughout your tenure in the group, we will explore paths and opportunities that will strengthen your skillset and move you toward your short- and long-term goals. Within the first month, fill out an Individual Development Form ([graduate students](https://www.unl.edu/gradstudies/current/development/idp), [postdocs](https://postdoc.unl.edu/current/idp_review/)) and meet with Noelle to discuss shared expectations and goals. We will revisit this on a regular basis to ensure you are making progress towards these goals, and adjust the direction and plan if needed over the course of the program. 

* I trust everyone in the group (including me) will be open to learn, work hard, be respectful, conscientious, and kind. I expect you to manage your own time and projects, but will share any time management tips that I've learned.

* I expect everyone to be active members of the department, start building your scientific network, and have fun! Attend the Biology and Ecology Center seminars, sign up to meet with speakers, and participate in social events.

* I expect everyone to [write, write, write](http://www.simonqueenborough.info/assets/pubs/bes-bulletin/2012-BESbulletin-writing.pdf)! We will do this in both informally and formally through weekly reflections, blog posts, summarizing ideas, applying for grants, and writing manuscripts.

* I expect you to get professional and academic advice from me as well as others, as having a diversity of feedback will better inform each decision. I expect you will seriously consider this advice and make your own informed decision.

* Take advantage of the training opportunities offered to graduate students by the [Office of Research and Graduate Studies](http://rgs.usu.edu/grts/), [Climate Adaptation Science Program](https://climateadaptation.usu.edu), and the [Ecology Center](http://ecology.usu.edu).

* For more information on institutional policies, follow the respective links for the graduate student [policies and handbook of the Department of Biology](https://biology.usu.edu/education/graduate-program/prospective_students) and [requirements for the Ecology Center](http://ecology.usu.edu/for_students/index).


## Your first day

* Read the Beckman Research group [code of conduct](https://github.com/SeedscapeEcology/Policies/blob/master/Code_of_Conduct.md). Chat with Noelle if you have any questions about group norms or would like to add or change anything in the code of conduct. 

* Join the Seedscape Ecology [slack channel](https://seedscapeecology.slack.com) by asking Noelle to send you an invite.

* Set up the weekly reflections by following the guidelines in the [Setting-up-your-weekly-meetings.md]() file. This will include a summary of your Individual Development Plan as well.


## Blog Posts

** Work in progress**

Opportunities to contribute to academic-related writings include:
* the [Seedscape Blog](https://seedscapeblog.wordpress.com/).
* [Verde Elemental](http://verde-elemental.org/) - focused on research in Latin America
* [CoDisperse blog](http://codisperse.weebly.com/blog) - focused on seed dispersal


An additional example from the Whitaker Lab:

## Miscellaneous
Some interesting articles on the importance of [stupidity](http://jcs.biologists.org/content/121/11/1771) and  [failure](http://www.southernfriedscience.com/the-need-to-fail/) in research.
